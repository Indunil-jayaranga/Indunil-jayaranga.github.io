This project focused on developing a sleek and modern mobile application for a fintech startup. The goal was to create an intuitive user experience that made financial management accessible and engaging for a younger audience.

The process began with extensive user research and competitive analysis to identify key features and design opportunities. We then moved into wireframing and prototyping, iterating on the design based on user feedback. The final app featured a clean interface, personalized insights, and robust security features, resulting in high user adoption and positive reviews.
